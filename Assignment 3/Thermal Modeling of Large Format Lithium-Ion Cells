This paper describes a thermal model that represents the heat generation behavior of a large format (10.5 Ah) Li-ion pouch cell.
The thermal model is based on the calculation of the heat generation from experimental measurements of internal resistance and
the entropic heat coefficient. Predictions from the thermal model are compared with experimental adiabatic calorimetry data. Higher
discharge rates and larger temperature operation ranges than the ones reported in prior studies are considered. Results from the
thermal model simulations have a prediction error of 21% in comparison with the experimental ones for discharge processes carried
out at moderate rates. For discharge processes carried out at high discharge rates a maximum prediction error of 15% has been
determined. The advantages and disadvantages of the model are further discussed, taking into account aspects such as accuracy,
model development and implementation in different thermal management system designs.
