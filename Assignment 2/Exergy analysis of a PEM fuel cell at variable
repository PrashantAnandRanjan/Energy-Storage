Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive exergy analysis of a 10 kW PEM fuel cell at variable operating
temperatures, pressures, cell voltages and air stoichiometrics. The calculations of the physical and chemical
exergies, mass flow rates and exergetic efficiency are performed at temperature ratios ðT =T0Þ and pressure
ratios ðP=P0Þ ranging from 1 to 1.25 and 1 to 3, respectively. In addition, the analysis is conducted on fuel
cell operating voltages of 0.5 and 0.6 V and at air stoichiometrics of 2, 3 and 4 in order to determine their
effects on the efficiency of the fuel cell. The calculated results illustrate the significance of the operating
temperature, pressure, cell voltage and air stoichiometry on the exergetic efficiency of the fuel cell. However, it is recommended that the fuel cell should operate at stoichiometric ratios less than 4 in order to
maintain the relative humidity level in the product air and to avoid the membrane drying out at high
operating temperatures.
